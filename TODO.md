# To do list:

* Don't return 404's if no results returned from successful database call; instead return response indicating 0 results
* Unit tests
* Config flag to allow 'city' query parameter without requiring 'item' query parameter
* Better logging and profiling
* Create branch where mode is calculated on server (instead of during db call) - do this to compare running performance
* Run under Ubuntu
* Think about where we might be able to employ caching
